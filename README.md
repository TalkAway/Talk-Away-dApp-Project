DAPP FUNCTIONS 

Function for payment in Near. The payment will be passed on to the teacher only after confirmation that the lesson has been held. An intelligent contract will be created to manage the payment of the lesson and distribution of the payment between the teacher and Talk Away.

There will be student and teacher check in and check out.

Dapp will have a space where the student will view their history of all the student's experiences with the tutor, based on the check in check out. After 3 months, the student will receive an evaluation from the tutor according to their experiences with a language proficiency leveling and will receive a certificate in NFT.

The app will use the cell phone's GPS sensor to display the class route.

The Dapp will also have a lesson scheduling function between tutor and student.

Students and tutors will be able to create NFTS in the Talk Away store that will use the tools provided by Mintbase. They will be added as minters in the Talk Away store in Mintbase.

A separate interface will be created on the talk away website for the NFT store, and the mintbase API will be used.

Product types:

Live classes to be scheduled on the website and pre-recorded classes available for sale online.
