Project Overview üìÑ

Talkaway is a social impact language learning startup that offers a unique and immersive learning experience. Our innovative approach involves learning languages through walking and exploring the city, making language learning both fun and practical. As a teaching platform on the web3, we are building a dapp and a metaverse prototype to further expand access to language learning. Our mission is to provide a differentiated teaching approach to promote language knowledge for people with limited financial resources and migratory vulnerability. We also aim to connect people from all over the world, fostering greater awareness of global cultural diversity.

Why a dapp? With smart contract technology, we will automate the student's journey, building a record of walks/classes and an automated evaluation system with certification in Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). 

Create a decentralized business plan, where a portion of the profit automatically goes to social projects that will be voted on by the community, not curated by the Talk Away founders. 
At the moment we have a Proof of Concept done on web2 and we have already done more than 100 classes/walks around the city of Rio de Janeiro. 

Finally, we will make a prototype of our metaverse. With places like markets and streets where the student can walk and live experiences to practice a new language. 

The classes offered with experiences from the walk is a solution to the great language teaching challenge we have in Brazil, many people do not adapt to formal language education, because it is a kind of subject that is learned through experience. Web 3 allows us to create experiences in virtual reality that are very propitious for this, uniting the digital and the physical reality. 
 








Now we have a POC in web2 and our education method is already tested: http://talkawaylanguage.com.

The (future) tokenomics of your project

With this grant we will build a dapp and create a journey like a logbook between the community and tutors, as well a decentralized finacial to social project. With a smart contract programation, the community will see the amount of money earmarked for social projects, projects can apply, and everyone will vote on which one will receive the help. Thus, talk away will be a social impact startup, not only aiming for profit.

Ecosystem Fit
Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

By integrating Talkaway's language learning platform with Polkadot/Kusama, the protocol could potentially access language learning data and insights, which could be used to enhance language learning outcomes and help individuals and organizations to better understand language acquisition. This could lead to the creation of new data-driven solutions and services that leverage insights from Talkaway's language learning platform.

Additionally, Talkaway's focus on promoting language knowledge for people with limited financial resources and migratory vulnerability could align with Ocean Protocol's mission to democratize access to data and empower underrepresented groups. Overall, integrating Talkaway with Polkadot could create new opportunities for data-driven innovation in language learning and support the broader mission of democratizing data access.

Building a language hub has great potential for onboarding people from the web2 to the web3 universe, and so one can see how decentralized technology is useful in education as a whole.

Polkadot will be fundamental to build the basic structure of the platform with advanced technology, and from there we will be able to scale our project. 

As a decentralized data exchange protocol, the blockchain provides a secure and decentralized way to share, monetize, and analyze data. By integrating with Polkadot/Kusama, Talkaway could potentially access a vast network of data providers and consumers who could be interested in leveraging Talkaway's language learning data and insights.

Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
What need(s) does your project meet?

Language tutors and students who would like to experience innovative teaching and learning methods. Age: 18-24 mostly. 


Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
No
If so, how is your project different?

Building a language hub has great potential for onboarding people from the web2 to the web3 universe, and so one can see how decentralized technology is useful in education as a whole.

If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
